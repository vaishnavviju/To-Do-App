# To-Do-App
This is an app created in flutter to store your daily to-do tasks. Firebase Authentication has been used for login and sign up so there will be no clash of email addresses or usernames and the user's data is protected. Users can enter new tasks by entering its title, description, date and the type of task. Users can view tasks and mark the completed ones. They can delete one or more notes. They can also edit the notes they have added. Users can view the notes using 6 tabs, "Tasks" shows all the tasks, "Overdue" shows the tasks which were supposed to be completed earlier, "Pending" shows the upcoming tasks and the other 3 tabs are used to view tasks by category.
